# EnglishModernization

**The ultimate modernization for the English language.**  
This project makes it possible to read English *without* getting a headache every time you hit a silent letter, a random vowel shift, or a word imported from 1400s French for no reason.

Instead of fighting with traditional spelling, this repo gives you:

- A **modern phonetic spelling** for the words people actually use today.
- A **converter script** that takes “ancient” English spelling and produces a consistent, readable phonetic form.

## What this project does

Traditional English spelling is:

- Inconsistent  
- Full of silent letters  
- Packed with one-off exceptions  
- A nightmare for learners, TTS engines, and frankly, most normal people  

This project replaces that mess with a **simplified phonetic spelling system**, mapping each common word into a form that:

- Looks like it sounds  
- Uses consistent patterns  
- Is easy to read and pronounce  
- Works well for text-to-speech or learning

In short: it turns:

> “you know what this does – better than anything – makes English actually readable.”

into something like:

> `yu no wut thees duz – betur than enithing – mayks inglish akshli ridubl.`

Same language, less suffering.
